## About the project
This project is simple. Its an e-commerce platform for household utilities and  apparels. It pulls the image data stored in database and presents it, and that is the <i>current</i> scope of this project. I plan on adding user authentication ( I have the database ready, just needed some more time) and expand the products available further. As of now, the project is a bit iffy on mobile screens as well, but that would be fixed in the coming days.
